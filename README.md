# HeWu
A Python package modeling effects of nuclear weapons, using public domain knowledge.\
\
HeWu came from the pronunciation of 核武, lit. "nuclear armament", in Chinese. It aims to provide an accessible interface to the best public domain nuclear weapon effects model, for the purpose of public information.\
\
Empirical models based on fitting to detailed calculations are preferred, and whenever possible, multiple sources are consulted and cross referenced with outstanding deviations noted.

# Status
